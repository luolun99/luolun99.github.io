    <h1>Smart Home Wen Application</h1>
    <h3>Author: Weng JinPeng</h3>
    <h5>
        we developed a small dynamic web application including routes, forms, and database
        access. In this assignment, you are tasked with creating another dynamic web application that will
        function as a dashboard to help your customers to control devices in their smart home. Essentially
        the dynamic web application interacts with users to provide information related to the status of
        devices at home such as cooling and heating systems, curtains and blinds, lighting, security, audiovisual systems
        such as TV, radio, music players, kitchen appliances such as fridge-freezer, hob,
        oven, microwave, etc. Then the system lets the customers control the devices by changing the status
        such as turning on or off, opening/closing, increasing/decreasing volumes, temperature, and so on.
        The user should be given the choice to add information related to their smart home and store it in
        the database. The web application should provide customers with the option of adding a device
        from a pre-organised list of devices and then to set or update the status of each device or appliance.
        As an example, the user should be able to select the ‘heating’ in the device list. Then set device
        status by turning the heating on and setting the temperature to 22 degrees. A full list of the
        functionalities of the web application is explained in the next sections of this document.
